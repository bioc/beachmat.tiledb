Package: beachmat.tiledb
Version: 0.1.0
Date: 2024-09-29
Title: beachmat bindings for TileDB-backed matrices
Description: 
    Extends beachmat to support initialization of tatami matrices from TileDB-backed arrays.
    This allows C++ code in downstream packages to directly call the TileDB C/C++ library to access array data,
    without the need for block processing via DelayedArray.
